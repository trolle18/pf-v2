        "description": "For my 2nd semester exam project, I worked along side two fellow students, on the website for ‘Be a hero’. A coaching company started in September 2021, by Benthe, with years of experience in the field. <br/> She already has an established customer base, but needed a responsive website, that gives a quick overview of her, her business, and its services. Furthermore, she needed a logo, and a cover photo for her LinkedIn business page.<br><br> We came up with a simple design that is easy to navigate, it is build with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. <br/> The logo is simple, and comes in multiple versions, for scalablility. To go with, I created what we refer to as a ‘cape’. The ‘cape’ is an organic, but clean-cut icon, inspired by a lavender flowerpetal, and a superhero cape.",
