        "description": "For my 2nd semester exam project, I worked along site two others on a website for the coaching company ‘Be a hero’. The company was started in September 2021, by Benthe Elisabeth Jørgensen, with years of experience in the field.",
        "more": "Benthe is passionate about helping people, to develop and unlock their talents and potential, and thus decided to start her own company to do just that.<br> She already has an established customer base, but needed a responsive website, with a purple color scheme and a cover photo of lavenders. <br> The website should be able to give a quick overview of her, her business, and its services. Furthermore, she needed a logo, and a cover photo for her LinkedIn business page.<br><br> We came up with a simple design that is easy to navigate, it is build with HTML/CSS and JS, and works on smartphones, tablets, and computers. The logo is simple, and scalable, and along it we created what we refer to as a ‘cape’ to go with the logo. The ‘cape’ is an organic but clean cut icon, inspired by the leaf of a lavender flower, and a superhero cape.",
